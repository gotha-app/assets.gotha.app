Hello one and all. You have just downloaded a free typeface from Spork Thug Typography. I hope you dig it. If you feel so inclined, send me a dollar if you want.
I make zines and comics as well, theyï¿½re two bucks if you want one. Okay, bye.

Vic Twenty. A computer-like font. Named after the first computer I ever had. Great.
